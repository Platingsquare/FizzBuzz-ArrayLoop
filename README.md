# Array&FizzBuzz
Menu for different tasks, including but not limited to Temperature calculations, Number guessing game, prime number calculations, A school assignment for numbers 0-100 and reversed ( don't know how I want to incorporate it yet and FizzBuzz a thing that essentially tells me if it is divisible by 3,5 or 15 for Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz.

I'm writing this after having posted FizzBuzz-ArrayLoop mk2. Idk if mk1 is now still visible. I am going to keep updating it for the school assignment but also try and include as many things I can that I think would be fun features. So far I haven't been able to get the debugging working. I'm still missing a median value calculator and wondering if I should just add that somehow to the future plan of the prime number calculator project. I also want to add a prime number identifier to my random number generator, where it will tell you it is a random number guessed or generated. I want to make for nr 6 Data processing assignment all in one, where it can calculate all the numbers put in and calculate a median from it.
